This release of Data by Region presents various data for 2011-2019 and Census of Population and Housing data for 2011 and 2016 and is based on the Statistical Area 3 (SA3) 2016 boundaries. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of income: Estimates of Personal Income, Gross Capital Gains, Selected Government Pensions and Allowances, Total Personal Income (Weekly) and Equivalised Total Household Income.<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1410.0Explanatory%20Notes12014-19?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/> AURIN has made the following changes to the original data:\n<ul><li>Spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1410.02014-19?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.001Main+Features10018July%202016?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">ABS Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) SA3 2016 dataset</a>.</li><li>Some data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.</li><li>Where data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.</li><li>Columns and rows that did not contain any values in the original data have been removed.</li></ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"yr","type":"Integer","title":"Year","description":"Year.","stype":"nominal","categories":[{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2017","label":"2017"},{"key":"2018","label":"2018"},{"key":"2019","label":"2019"}],"filterValue":"2019","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa3_code_2016","type":"String","title":"SA3 Code","description":"SA3 Code (ASGS 2016).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"equivalised_total_household_income_census_median_weekly","type":"Integer","title":"Equivalised Total Household Income  - Census Median equivalised total household income (weekly) ($)","description":"Equivalised Total Household Income  - Census Median equivalised total household income (weekly) ($).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_mean_employee","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Mean employee income ($)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Mean employee income ($).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_mean_investment","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Mean investment income ($)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Mean investment income ($).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_median_employee","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Median employee income ($)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Median employee income ($).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_median_investment","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Median investment income ($)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Median investment income ($).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_total_employee_m","type":"Double","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Total employee income ($m)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Total employee income ($m).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estimates_personal_income_year_ended_30_june_total_investment_m","type":"Double","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Total investment income ($m)","description":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Total investment income ($m).","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"estm_prsnl_incme_yr_end_30_jne_mdn_tl_excl_gvrnmt_pns_alwncs","type":"Integer","title":"Estimates of Personal Income - Year ended 30 June Median total income (excl.
