Data for 2011-12 to 2016-17 at the state, territory and national levels are weighted to account for agency non-response and invalid statistical linkage keys (SLK), and have been rounded to the nearest integer. Due to improvements in agency response and rates of SLK validity, data from 2017?18 are no longer weighted. The removal of weighting does not constitute a break in time series, and these data are directly comparable with weighted counts for earlier years. As the weighting method is not suitable for sub-state units, the data in the sub-state cubes are not weighted.</li>\n<li>Clients are considered to be homeless if they are living in any of the following circumstances: No shelter or improvised dwelling, Short-term temporary accommodation, House, townhouse or flat (couch surfing or with no tenure).</li>\n<li>Clients are considered to be at risk of homelessness if they are living in any of the following circumstances: Public or community housing (renter or rent free), Private or other housing (renter, rent-free or owner), Institutional settings.</li>\n</ul><br> AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/homelessness-services/shsc-data-cubes/contents/specialist-homelessness-services-collection-shsc-data-cubes\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"fin_yr","type":"String","title":"Financial Year","description":"fin_yr","stype":"nominal","categories":[{"key":"2014-15","label":"2014-15"},{"key":"2015-16","label":"2015-16"},{"key":"2016-17","label":"2016-17"},{"key":"2017-18","label":"2017-18"},{"key":"2018-19","label":"2018-19"}],"filterValue":"2018-19","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa3_code","type":"String","title":"SA3 Code","description":"SA3 2016 code","isDimension":false},{"name":"client_count","type":"Integer","title":"Client Count","description":"client_count","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa3_name","type":"String","title":"SA3 Name","description":"SA3 2016 name","isDimension":false},{"name":"feature_code","type":"java.lang.String","title":"Code of Geographic feature","stype":"Nominal","description":"","isDimension":false},{"name":"feature_name","type":"java.lang.String","title":"Name of Geographic feature","stype":"Nominal","description":"","isDimension":false},{"name":"the_geom","type":"com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.MultiPolygon","title":"Geometry","stype":"Nominal","description":"","isDimension":false}],"filter":null}
